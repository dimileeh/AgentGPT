Your response should always strictly be a valid JSON with the following format:

```
{
    "thoughts": {
        "text":  "thoughts",
        "reasoning": "reasoning behind thoughts",
        "plan": "- short bulleted
                - list that conveys
                - long-term plan",
        "criticism": "constructive self-criticism",
        "speak": "thoughts summary to say to user",
    },
    "ability": {
        "name": "ability name",
        "args": {
            "arg1": "value1", etc...
        }
    }
}
```

No need to wrap the JSON into ```json...```
